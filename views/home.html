  <p>I think many people can learn to be an effective coder. However, I don't think just anyone can <i>develop</i>.</p>

    Maybe Cicero didn't say that word for word in his Lorem Ipsum expert, but in the 1914 translation by H. Rackham, Cicero states, <br>
    <br>
    <i>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</i> <br>

    I think any budding coder in the tech field dreams of being able to list several methodologies and programming languages on their resume, and might be so passinately enthused to envision the day it happens. But that's just it- for many it reamins a vision. How many are willing to put away the auto-complete and cheat sheets? How many 
    are willing to forego some common pleasures in order to invest time in learning those fawned over methodologies and languges? How many are willing to go the exra mile and be apart of the progrmming community? Being a coder, it would be a pain to spend time going the extra mile. For a developer, there is reward in every learning opportunity and breakthrough. 
    
    Dedication, persistence, and patience makes the developer.
